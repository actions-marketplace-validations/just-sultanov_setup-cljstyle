How to update this action.

## Development

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 9, for instance.

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:

```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  __tests__/main.test.ts
  âœ“ version should be correctly parsed (2 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total

Ran all test suites.
...
```

## Validate

Push your changes to the repository and check results of the test workflow.

## Publish

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:

```bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```
